Hi everyone!
It's a pleasure to meet you here I'm Gung and I created this app as a task for Open Recruitment of the RISTEK Organization in Faculty of Computer Science University of Indonesia

I'm very grateful for this opportunity as it gave me my first ever experience and touchpoint with Dart and Flutter. I truly love mobile app development after doing this task, and I'm very eager to continue learning and expanding my knowledge. :D

Before starting this project, I started by getting information by having talks with my seniors. Such as, is it better to design the app in figma first prior to coding and more, and how to start a new project. Upon having a larger picture and some understanding I then moved on and opened VSCode and started scripting.

I referred to a Lot of Youtube Tutorial Videos to make the Todo List, basic Login and Signup with Local Storage system and the Pomodoro Countdown System. I also used external images that are sourced from Google.

Some of the references I used are:

And also with some help from Co-Pilot and Chatgpt for bug fixes and integrations ^-^

I truly enjoyed working on this project and once again I'm very grateful for this experience. I hope I could take part in working on the Mobile App Division of RISTEK and contribute, learn, and grow whlist creating products that creates an impact to the people around me. :D
